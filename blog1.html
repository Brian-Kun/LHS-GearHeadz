                <hr>

                
                <p>The beginning of the day was rather uneventful; people were tired (because of the gosh darn daylight savings and just waking up early in general) and we weren't going up any ranks. Yeah, we got 18th place once but we went back down to maybe 26th or 31st place... I don't remember. Good thing about the morning was the two breakfasts some of us got to eat due to a surplus of food. Some of us could have been crying while eating, I don't know, maybe. (not really, don't worry lol) But WE WERE JUST TIRED OKAY THATS MY POINT. </p>

              

                <p>But the day progressed and we were zooming through matches until we got to the alliance selection. Obviously, we weren't in the top ten that got to create alliances so it wasn't a surprise when we weren't called up for those. The teams were inviting others teams to their alliances and such and they "graciously" accepted. I REMEMBER 3566 GOT REJECTED (or was declined, to put it in a nicer way) BY A TEAM, I FORGOT THEIR NUMBER. Every single time a team was inviting, I was so anxious to see if someone would ever say our name. Everybody was anxious, in fact. The anxiety levels went all the way up there when it was the last selection though. It was just so nerve-wrecking.</p>

                <p>BUT OH MY GOSHHHHHHHHHHHHH WE ALL FREAKED OUT WHEN THEY (i forgot the teams we were allianced with) SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO INVITE 1289 WE WERE LIKE YEAHHHHHH. SOME PEOPLE EVEN STARTED CRYING I WAS ABOUT TO CRY I JUST IT WAS AMAZING. AND WE ACCEPTED WOOP IT WAS AWESOME. I WAS JUMPING AROUND AND LUNCH WAS THE BEST. It was so incredibly exciting.</p>

                <p>When I was told that it was the first time we have been selected for an alliance in a really long time, I was really shocked. I could only imagine how it could have felt to finish in the last twenty and then just go home; our mentors have really done a lot. Although it was only my second competition, I saw how much the team has achieved and how much hard work has been done for us to be this far. I was really happy to be in robotics in that moment and be a part of such an amazing family. </p>

                <p>ANYWAYS (enough of all the sentiments) after lunch the playoffs started and it was a natural high for me, honestly. All the enthusiasm and the cheering and general happy in the area felt fantastic. We won our first playoff match just by a couple of points. Unfortunately, we lost our second playoff match. There were alliances that stacked totes with barrels on top extremely fast. Like at the end of the two minutes, there would be four stacks with barrels and the points would reach 100 if not past it. There were clearly teams much faster than we were, but we ended up going home extremely satisfied with the results. I still can't believe that it was the first time we had been picked for an alliance since '04. There are much more competitions to come and improvements along with it. I can't wait for the next competition, even if we don't get to go into the playoffs. </p>

                <p>YAY GEARHEADZ~! We got this. We got all of it.</p>

                 <h3>Monica Sim</h3>
                 <p>Hello! I'm Monica Sim, 15 year old freshman at MST. In robotics, I'm here and there. I dabble in a bit of mechanical, but my official sort of "tag" for robotics is under the fundraising team. During the competitions, I'm in the safety team, pit crew, and the fundraising team. Usually cheering in the stands and freaking out when we do well. But outside of all the meetings, my main hobby is procrastinating to the ultimate max level. I also like to call myself a little advocate for self-love, self-improvement, and just living in the present. I try to write stories (Emphasis on try... Having a lot of goals, but being a big procrastinator is bad.) and I like to journal here and there as well. Both riding an elephant and watching all the animes in the world are on my bucket list. Yeah, so that's my little autobiography~</p>
